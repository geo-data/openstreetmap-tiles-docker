# OpenStreetMap Tile Server Container

This repository contains instructions for building a
[Docker](https://www.docker.io/) image containing the OpenStreetMap tile
serving software stack.  It is based on the
[Switch2OSM instructions](http://switch2osm.org/serving-tiles/manually-building-a-tile-server-12-04/).

As well as providing an easy way to set up and run the tile serving software it
also provides instructions for managing the back end database, allowing you to:

* Create the database
* Import OSM data into the database
* Drop the database

Run `docker run homme/openstreetmap-tiles` for usage instructions.
